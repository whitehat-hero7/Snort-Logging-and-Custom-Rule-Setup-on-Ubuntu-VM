## 1. Snort Logging Setup
**`Snort`** offers versatile logging options, including **`Plain Text`**, **`JSON`**, **`PCAP`**, and more, allowing flexible data analysis and integration with other security tools. In this exercise, we'll configure and learn different aspects of Snortâ€™s logging settings, set up proper directory permissions, test the logging output, and address common troubleshooting scenarios you might encounter when using **`Plain Text`** and **`PCAP`** logging.

### ðŸ”¸Step 1: Choose a Logging Format
**`Snort`** supports multiple logging formats depending on your needs:


| **Format** | **Use Case** |
|-|-|
|Plain Text (`alert_fast`) | Simple, human-readable alerts|
|PCAP (`log_pcap`) | Captures full packet data for deep analysis|
|JSON (`alert_json`) | Structured logs for SIEMs like Splunk or ELK|
|Unified2 (`log_unified2`) | Optimized binary format for Barnyard2 processing|
|Syslog (`log_syslog`) | Sends alerts to a centralized syslog server|
|Full (`log_full`) | Logs complete packet payloads and metadata|
|CSV ( `log_csv`) | Stores alerts in a structured, comma-separated format|

(**Note:** **`JSON`** format was introduced in **`Snort 3`**, for this exercise we are running on **`Snort version 2.9.20`**, so it is not available for us to configure at this time).

### ðŸ”¸Step 2: Configure Snort Logging
**ðŸ”µ Edit the Snort configuration file:** *`sudo nano /etc/snort/snort.conf`*

#### ðŸŸ¢ Enable Plain Text Logging (Default)
**`Plain Text`** logging is the simplest and most straightforward way to capture and review **`Snort`** alerts. When enabled, **`Snort`** writes alerts directly to a log file in an easy-to-read format. This method is useful for basic monitoring, debugging, and quick analysis without requiring additional tools.

Add the following output directive to the **`Snort`** configuration file (**`snort.conf`**).

**Output Directive:** **`output alert_fast: /var/log/snort/alert.log`**

Before:

After:
[Insert Screenshot] plaintext_after.png

| **Part** | **Explanation** |
|-|-|
| `output` | Specifies that **`Snort`** should generate an output.|
| `alert_fast` | Tells **`Snort`** to use the "**`Fast Alert`**" logging format, which logs alerts in a concise, one-line format.|
| `/var/log/snort/alert.log` | Defines the file path where **`Snort`** will store alert logs.|

This stores alerts in **`/var/log/snort/alert.log`** in a human-readable format.

**ðŸ”¹Log Entry - Format Example:**
|02/28-14:32:17.001234 [* *] [1:1000001:1] ICMP Ping Detected [**] [Priority: 3] {ICMP} 192.168.1.5 -> 192.168.1.1|
|-|

**ðŸ”¹Understanding Each Part of the Log Entry:**

| **Part** | **Explanation** |
|-|-|
| `02/28-14:32:17.001234` | **Timestamp** (MM/DD-HH:MM:SS.Milliseconds) when the alert was triggered.|
| `[**] [1:1000001:1]` | **Snort rule metadata: [Generator ID: Rule ID: Revision]**. This helps identify the specific rule that triggered the alert.|
| `ICMP Ping Detected` | **Alert message**, describing the detected activity.|
| `[Priority: 3]` | The **priority level** of the alert (**lower is more critical**).|
| `{ICMP}` | The **protocol** associated with the alert (e.g., **TCP**, **UDP**, **ICMP**). |
| `192.168.1.5 -> 192.168.1.1` | **Source and destination IP addresses** for the detected activity. |

**ðŸ”¹How to View and Analyze Plain Text Logs:**

Once logging is enabled and **`Snort`** is running, you can check alerts using the following commands:

**ðŸ“œ View the last 10 alerts:** *`sudo tail -n 10 /var/log/snort/alert.log`*

**ðŸ“œ Monitor alerts in real time:** *`sudo tail -f /var/log/snort/alert.log`*

**ðŸ“œ Search for specific alerts (e.g., ICMP traffic):** *`sudo grep "ICMP" /var/log/snort/alert.log`*

**ðŸ”¹Why Use Plain Text Logging:**

**âœ… Easy to read:** The output is simple and human-readable.

**âœ… Quick analysis:** No additional tools are required to view logs.

**âœ… Lightweight:** Uses minimal system resources compared to database logging.

**âœ… Good for troubleshooting:** Helps validate whether **`Snort`** is working correctly.

However, plain text logging **lacks structure** for automated log analysis. If you plan to integrate **`Snort`** with log management or **`SIEM`** tools (e.g., **`Splunk`**, **`ELK Stack`**), **`JSON`** or **`Unified2`** formats are better choices, but they are introduced on **`Snort 3`**.

#### ðŸŸ¢ Enable PCAP Logging (For Packet Capture & Deep Analysis)

**`PCAP (Packet Capture)`** logging in **`Snort`** allows you to record full network packets for later analysis. This is useful for deep forensic investigation, intrusion analysis, and troubleshooting network threats. Security analysts often use **`PCAP`** logs with tools like **`Wireshark`**, **`Zeek`**, or **`tcpdump`** to inspect raw network traffic.

Add the following output directive to the **`Snort`** configuration file (**`snort.conf`**).

**Output Directive:** **`output log_tcpdump: /var/log/snort/log.pcap`**

[Insert Screenshot] log_pcap.png

| **Part** | **Explanation** |
|-|-|
| `output` | Specifies that **`Snort`** should generate an output.|
| `log_tcpdump` | Tells **`Snort`** to store network packets in **`PCAP`** format, similar to how **`Wireshark`** captures packets.|
| `/var/log/snort/log.pcap` | Defines the file path where **`Snort`** will capture network traffic.|

This format allows you to analyze **full network packets** in **`Wireshark`**.

**ðŸ”¹What Does a PCAP Log Contain?**

Unlike **`Plain Text`** or **`JSON`** logs, **`PCAP`** files contain raw packet data, including:

**âœ… Packet headers** (source/destination IPs, ports, protocols, timestamps).

**âœ… Packet payloads** (actual transmitted data).

**âœ… Full conversation reconstruction** between attackers and victims.

**âœ… Deep packet inspection** for advanced forensic investigations.

A **`PCAP`** log does **not** contain human-readable text like **`JSON`** or **`Plain Text`** logs. Instead, it **stores raw network packets** that need to be analyzed using tools like **`Wireshark`** or **`tcpdump`**.

**ðŸ”¹How to View and Analyze PCAP Logs**

Once **`PCAP`** logging is enabled and **`Snort`** is running, you can inspect captured packets using:

**ðŸ“œ Check if the PCAP log file exists:** *`ls -l /var/log/snort/log.pcap`*

**ðŸ“œ Analyze the PCAP log using tcpdump:** *`sudo tcpdump -r /var/log/snort/log.pcap`*

**ðŸ“œ Open the PCAP log in Wireshark (GUI):** *`wireshark /var/log/snort/log.pcap`*

**ðŸ“œ Filter PCAP logs to show only HTTP traffic:** *`sudo tcpdump -r /var/log/snort/log.pcap -nn -A port 80`*

**ðŸ“œ Extract and display only source/destination IPs from the PCAP log:** *`sudo tcpdump -r /var/log/snort/log.pcap -nn -q`*

**ðŸ”¹Why Use PCAP Logging?**

**âœ… Capture Full Network Packets:** Unlike text-based alerts, **`PCAP`** logs store complete packet data for forensic analysis.

**âœ… Advanced Investigation:** Allows security analysts to **reconstruct network attacks, extract malware payloads, and analyze exploit techniques**.

**âœ… Integration with Wireshark & Zeek:** Enables **deep traffic analysis** and **protocol inspection** for detailed insights.

**âœ… Ideal for Network Forensics & Incident Response:** Helps **correlate attack patterns** and **understand adversary techniques**.

### ðŸ”¸Step 3: Create the Logging Directory

Before **`Snort`** can store its logs, you must create a dedicated directory and configure the proper permissions. This ensures that **`Snort`** can write logs securely and prevents permission issues during runtime.

**ðŸ”¹Why Do We Need a Logging Directory?**

**âœ… Ensures Snort has a specific location** to store logs such as alerts, packet captures, and event data.

**âœ… Prevents permission issues** that could cause **`Snort`** to fail when trying to write logs.

**âœ… Improves organization** by keeping all **`Snort`** logs in one central location.

**âœ… Enhances security** by restricting access to **`Snortâ€™s`** log files.


**ðŸ”µ Create the Logging Directory:** *`sudo mkdir -p /var/log/snort`*

[Insert Screenshot] create_log_directory.png

**Command Breakdown:**

| **Command** | **Explanation** |
|-|-|
| *`sudo`* | Runs the command with superuser (**`root`**) privileges to avoid permission issues.|
| *`mkdir`* | Creates a new directory.|
| *`-p`* | Ensures that if the directory already exists, it wonâ€™t return an error.|

**ðŸ”¹Why use /var/log/snort?**

âœ… The **`/var/log/`** directory is the standard location for system and application logs.

âœ… Keeping **`Snort`** logs here maintains consistency with Linux logging conventions.

**ðŸ”µ Set the Correct Permissions:** *`sudo chmod -R 755 /var/log/snort`*

[Insert Screenshot] Set_permissions.png

**Command Breakdown:**

| **Command** | **Explanation** |
|-|-|
| *`sudo`* | Runs the command with superuser (**`root`**) privileges to avoid permission issues.|
| *`chmod`* | Changes file/directory permissions.|
| *`-R`* | Recursively applies the permission change to all files and subdirectories.|
| *`755`* | Assigns **read, write, and execute (rwx) permissions** to the owner, and **read and execute (r-x) permissions** to others.|

**ðŸ”¹What does *755* mean?**

**âœ… Owner (snort):** Read, write, and execute (**rwx**) = 7

**âœ… Group (snort):** Read and execute (**r-x**) = 5

**âœ… Others:** Read and execute (**r-x**) = 5

This setup ensures that **`Snort`** can write logs, but other users cannot modify them.

**ðŸ”µ Set Ownership to the Snort User:** *`sudo chown -R snort:snort /var/log/snort`*

[Insert Screenshot] Set_ownership.png

**Command Breakdown:**

| **Command** | **Explanation** |
|-|-|
| *`sudo`* | Runs the command with superuser (**`root`**) privileges to avoid permission issues.|
| *`chown`* | Changes ownership of a file or directory.|
| *`-R`* | Recursively applies the ownership change to all files and subdirectories.|
| *`snort:snort`* | Assigns both user (`snort`) and group (`snort`) ownership.|
| *`/var/log/snort`* | Target directory where ownership is changed.|
