# Snort Logging Setup and Custom Rules on Ubuntu VM

## Objective
**`Snort`** is a powerful open-source **`Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDS/IPS)`** designed to analyze network traffic and detect potential threats in real time. This comprehensive guide walks you through the step-by-step process of configuring **`Snort`** logging and custom rule creation within an **`Ubuntu VM`** running on a **`VirtualBox`** home lab. By following this guide, youâ€™ll gain hands-on experience in monitoring network activity, identifying security threats, and fine-tuning **`Snortâ€™s`** detection capabilities to generate custom alerts for suspicious behavior, enhancing both your cybersecurity skills and your ability to respond to real-world attacks.

## 1. Snort Logging Setup
**`Snort`** offers versatile logging options, including **`Plain Text`**, **`JSON`**, **`PCAP`**, and more, allowing flexible data analysis and integration with other security tools. In this exercise, we'll configure Snortâ€™s logging settings, set up proper directory permissions, test the logging output, and address common troubleshooting scenarios you might encounter when using **`Plain Text`** logging.

### ðŸ”¸Step 1: Choose a Logging Format
**`Snort`** supports multiple logging formats depending on your needs:


| **Format** | **Use Case** |
|-|-|
|Plain Text (`alert_fast`) | Simple, human-readable alerts|
|PCAP (`log_pcap`) | Captures full packet data for deep analysis|
|JSON (`alert_json`) | Structured logs for SIEMs like Splunk or ELK|
|Unified2 (`log_unified2`) | Optimized binary format for Barnyard2 processing|
|Syslog (`log_syslog`) | Sends alerts to a centralized syslog server|
|Full (`log_full`) | Logs complete packet payloads and metadata|
|CSV ( `log_csv`) | Stores alerts in a structured, comma-separated format|

(**Note:** **`JSON`** format was introduced in **`Snort 3`**, for this exercise we are running on **`Snort version 2.9.20`**, so it is not available for us to configure at this time).

### ðŸ”¸Step 2: Configure Snort Logging
Edit the **`Snort`** configuration file: **`sudo nano /etc/snort/snort.conf`**

Then, locate the **`(Step #6: Configure output plugins)`** section, scroll down and uncomment or add any of the following logging methods (e.g., **`Plain Text`**, **`PCAP`**, etc.) you prefer:

#### âœ… Enable Plain Text Logging (Default)
**`Plain Text`** logging is the simplest and most straightforward way to capture and review **`Snort`** alerts. When enabled, **`Snort`** writes alerts directly to a log file in an easy-to-read format. This method is useful for basic monitoring, debugging, and quick analysis without requiring additional tools.

Add the following output directive to the **`Snort`** configuration file (**`snort.conf`**).

**Output Directive**: **`output alert_fast: /var/log/snort/alert.log`**

| **Part** | **Explanation** |
|-|-|
| `output` | Specifies that **`Snort`** should generate an output.|
| `alert_fast` | Tells **`Snort`** to use the "**`Fast Alert`**" logging format, which logs alerts in a concise, one-line format.|
| `/var/log/snort/alert.log` | Defines the file path where **`Snort`** will store alert logs.|

This stores alerts in **`/var/log/snort/alert.log`** in a human-readable format.

**ðŸ”¹Format Example:**

02/28-14:32:17.001234 [* *] [1:1000001:1] ICMP Ping Detected [**] [Priority: 3] {ICMP} 192.168.1.5 -> 192.168.1.1
